### The challenge

Create a Product Preview Card that changes layout depend on the size of the screen. I didn't have access to FIGMA or SKETCH to get accurate design solutions, so I eyeballed it close enough to the provided designs.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

As my first Frontend Mentor Challenge, it took me around 6 hours to complete. I have not done any challenges on my own before, so this was tough even for a newbie challenge. Wanted to quit a few times, but kept at it and got my designs close enough to the intended design.

### Continued development

I will spend some extra time on layout with HTML and CSS before moving to JavaScript.
